                    The Peugeot family of industrialists and engineers, dating back to the 15th century, maintains its
                    leading position
                    in
                    company still. The family company "Peugeot Brothers and Sons" in the second half of the 19th century
                    produced
                    near the
                    traditional for her iron products, bicycles and parts for crews.

                    In 1889, Leon Serpollet built the first steam car for the company, quite successful, taking
                    participation in the steam car race along the Paris-Lyon route. But the head of the bicycle company
                    Armand Peugeot, who was friends with Emile Levassor, one of the pioneers of the automobile industry
                    in France,
                    With his help, he met G. Daimler and built his first car with gasoline
                    Daimler engine in 1891. Although the model was not particularly original, its success inspired
                    Arman to create a whole series next year, consisting of 10 different types of machines. One of
                    cars participated in the Paris-Brest-Paris bicycle race in the same year and attracted
                    everyone's attention. This proved to the fledgling automaker that an important part of commercial
                    car racing can become a success.

                    In 1892, Peugeot received the most interesting order - to build an elegant car for an Algerian bey
                    with a 4-cylinder engine and a body made of cast silver (this unique model is the decoration of the
                    company's museum).
                    The Peugeot car took part in the world's first automobile race, the Paris-Rouen "great run".
                    July 22, 1894, arriving second after the steam train De Dion-Bouton ("De Dion-Brunka").

                    Peugeot at the beginning of the 20th century, in line with the trends of that time, strives to
                    create a cheap car,
                    as simple, reliable and adapted to urban conditions as possible. For these purposes, the company is
                    invited
                    outstanding engineer and designer E. Bugatti. Such a prototype of the "people's car" was created by
                    him
                    Bebe Peugeot ("Baby Peugeot"). But another direction in the company's activities was not forgotten -
                    racing and
                    record cars. The Peugeot Goux 1913 model develops a speed of 187 km / h, an absolute record for
                    those
                    years The company was the first in France to introduce conveyor assembly in these years, buying the
                    rights to it
                    the method of engineer E. Taylor.
